Additionally, wooden utensils are less likely to react with the food being cooked, as they do not contain any metallic elements that could potentially transfer to the food. However, wooden utensils can be more challenging to clean and maintain than metal ones, and they may not be as durable or long-lasting.", "answer_id": "hqfxGHdbt9zLBMwsPP27R9", "model_id": "llava-v1.5-7b", "metadata": {}}
