Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest for about 30 minutes.\n\n2. Shape the donuts: Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it reaches the desired thickness. Cut out donut shapes using a donut cutter or a round cookie cutter.\n\n3. Fry the donuts: Heat a pot or deep fryer with oil (preferably around 350\u00b0F or 175\u00b0C) and carefully lower the donuts into the hot oil. Fry the donuts until they turn golden brown on both sides.\n\n4. Drain and cool the donuts: Once the donuts are cooked, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon or tongs and place them on a paper towel or a wire rack to drain any excess oil. Allow the donuts to cool for a few minutes.\n\n5. Coat the donuts with sugar: While the donuts are still warm, roll them in a bowl of granulated or powdered sugar, ensuring they are evenly coated.\n\n6. Serve: Place the sugar-coated donuts on a plate or in a bowl, and serve them immediately.\n\nThis recipe will produce delicious, sweet donuts that can be enjoyed as a dessert or snack.", "answer_id": "nh8VRjdg3UN4ED85KaFBhF", "model_id": "llava-v1.5-7b", "metadata": {}}
